* VSCode is an IDE for various programming languages such
as Java, Python, and alike.
* To install VSCode, go to this link: https://code.visualstudio.com/
and make sure the environment is setup for Java (if you use Java) in
both your computer and on VSCode.
* As said by others: _Start Early, Start Often!_

**Remotely Connecting:**


* In this class, we learn techniques/basics about
connecting remotely to a server.
* To connect to a remote server (for this class) open
VSCode and the terminal and type the following: (Don't type the $)

`$ ssh cs15lsp22zzz@ieng6.ucsd.edu `
* zzz in cs15lsp22zzz@ieng6 is your own login to connect to the server.
