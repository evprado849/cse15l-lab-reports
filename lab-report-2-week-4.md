**Test File- Failure(s):**


**Symptom:**







**Relationship with Bug, Symptom, and Failure Input:**
* Bug: Error / Faults in Computer Code/System
* Symptom: Faulty Behavior in Program 
* Failure Input: Unexpected Input / Error Outputs

_Relationship Between the Three:_

A program can have a bug that gives an unexpected output (i.e 2 + 2 is expecting 4, but gives 5).
A symptom can be from this program is that it is expecting a number that is outputted, to be even,
however, is odd. Failure input would be that the solution was expecting true for even, but 
false instead.
