**Test File Failures and Relationships:**
* [Information Came From Here](https://blog.regehr.org/archives/199)
* Bug: A flaw in computer system that could have some symptoms.
* Symptom: Faulty behavior that you can see 
* Failure-Inducing Input: Input from user that causes bugs and symptoms to show.

**Relationship with Bug, Symptom, and Failure Input in MarkdownParse.java: **

**Symptom:**







**Relationship with Bug, Symptom, and Failure Input:**
* Bug: Error / Faults in Computer Code/System
* Symptom: Faulty Behavior in Program 
* Failure Input: Unexpected Input / Error Outputs

_Relationship Between the Three:_

A program can have a bug that gives an unexpected output (i.e 2 + 2 is expecting 4, but gives 5).
A symptom can be from this program is that it is expecting a number that is outputted, to be even,
however, is odd. Failure input would be that the solution was expecting true for even, but 
false instead.
