**Lab Report 5**

[My Repository](https://github.com/evprado849/markdown-parser)

[Given Repository](https://github.com/nidhidhamnani/markdown-parser)


_Using vimdiff for differences:_
* I see how different my implmentations for my MarkdownParse vs the given Repository. It's very different from the given Repository because I remember how in the last Report, my implementation was buggy.
* After running the scripts for both my own repository and on the given repository, I recall that on the given repository, I got successful [] (brackets] for those that don't have a link/contents, however, for those that did have cotnents within them, it contained links (i.e: [https://something.com], just an example).
* However, my implementation was buggy because I kept getting an out of bounds exception for several of them, so after seeing how after running the scripts and seeing the differences are of my repo and the given one, I'll try to debug it so that some (or most tests) can pass.
